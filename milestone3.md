- User logs in using existing email and password. We will set up a signup page later on and will allow the user to connect to different social media platforms.

These screenshots are almost completely different from the protototypes we've done in milestone2.md. The main reason for this is due to us switching back to our original idea. Milestone2's storyboards and prototypes are based on the idea of creating a collaborative space for other individuals but doesn't fit this class's theme. As a result, we decided to revert back to our original idea which dealth with visualizing news in a spatial format. This created a more interesting and interactive way for individuals to consume news. Since these are two completely separate ideas, the UI and our skeleton were a bit different. Although our current skeleton is entirely different from the first prototype in milestone2.md, it does strike a resemblence to our prototype 2. 

These screenshots have a map to the right and a side menu to the left. The left portion will be dedicated to filtering and possibly seeing detailed content. The righit portion will be a map that shows map spatially. Clicking on different circles will allow users to see news through location instead of the usual headline and chronological format. The content on the left (or possibly on top of the map) will have different filtering or visualization options. For example, you can click on crime rate and will visualize crime rate in the map which will give the user a better understanding of the background context of the news. 

  ## Note: Our application will mostly be a single-page application. The homepage will allow the user to filter through different visualization. In the home page, the user can do multiple different interactions that will visualize and perform different content.


## Backend:

Mostly used Node.js to handle most of the backend content of our application. Navigation and loading content based on a data from a remote server (e.g. our api) is done through node.js.

## APIs:
