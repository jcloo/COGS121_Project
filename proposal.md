Proposal Paragraph(s):

Our project idea is centered around the idea of implementing a 3D-interactive website that uses Twitter and other news API.
That is, students and other users can view a map with different news and statistics in the form of circles spread out throughout a local region based on where that piece came from. Furthermore, users can filter different visualizations of the map such as crime rate, weather, congestion, etc. to get a better understanding of that certain piece of news. We're not sure on the specifics yet but we're planning to use a MapBox api to create the map and use webgl for the 3-d part. This can be subject to change once we finalize our plan. 

- idea 2: maybe we should make a 3d "network" of friends on like fb (visualize how you interact with different friends on social networks)
