## Project Proposal Paragraphs:

- *Our project idea* is centered around the idea of implementing a 3D-interactive website that uses Twitter and other news API. That is, students and other users can view a map with different news and statistics in the form of circles spread out throughout a local region based on where that piece came from. Furthermore, users can filter different visualizations of the map such as crime rate, weather, congestion, etc. to get a better understanding of that certain piece of news. We're not sure on the specifics yet but we're planning to use a MapBox api to create the map and use webgl for the 3-d part. This can be subject to change once we finalize our plan. 

- *idea 2*: Establish a 3D environment encapsulating an online community that focuses on connecting people with an interest in media related topics such as art, design, film, music and more through public various public forums in which they can share relevant information and work with one another for various reasons.
