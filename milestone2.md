Dashboard type of design. Users can explore different ideas posted by others
in the form of cards. Users will have their own profile and portfolio that
outlines the kinds of works they have done in order to attract others to
working with them.

In addition to exploring different ideas, users can create and share their own
ideas of projects they want to work on. They can include which type of people
he/she is looking for when doing this project. Other users will be able to
view this idea where they can message or apply to that certain project.

We envision this web app in being a collaborative space for these ideas.
Users will also be able to access the projects they are a part of / got into.
![Prototype 1_9](/images/prototype1_9.png)
Users will be able to save/favorite certain ideas and easily communicate
with others who have similar interests in this space.

## Prototype 2:

Map interface if people prefer using a map to identify users. Displays users
interested in collaborating based on their cities. User filters out furthest
distance to stop looking for users, mini-profile page of other users displayed
on the left.

Icons on the right symbolize: home, settings, new post, notifications,
messages. When you click on an icon, a pop-up of desired page shows up in the
same page.
